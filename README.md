# Morel Data Exploration


I pulled data from two APIs: iNaturalist, which stores and categorizes user observations of living things, and OpenMeteo, which offers free historical weather data. 

I matched the weather data with obserations of morel mushrooms in the wild and explored humidity as well as air and soil temperature in the two weeks preceding the observation of a mature mushroom (the mushrooms take anywhere from 7-12 days to reach maturity).

While I didn't discover anything groundbreaking about morel ecology, I did identify the ranges of humidity of temperature that allow for morel emergence.

This project was the capstone for my Google Data Analytics Certficate. The first notebook outlines the process of grabbing data from the respective APIs using Python / Pandas and the second is an exploration of the data.
